# Financial_Analytics
Example materials for Weeks 6 and 7 of a financial analytics and modeling course.  More information about this course can be found in "Preparing Analytics-enabled Professionals in Finance Using a Simultaneous Team-teaching Approach."

## Week 6

In Week 6, the finance faculty member would review the financial concepts and calculations involved in forecasting.  The demonstration would use data sources that were covered in the first unit of the course (for data wrangling) to provide connection between the first and second units in the course.  At the end of the week, students would complete homework that required them to create appropriate forecasts using Microsoft Excel.  Materials such as Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and comma-separated value (CSV) data files would be provided to students.

Example materials for this week are contained in the Week 06 folder within this repository.  In addition, this folder contains an in-depth description of the teaching approach.


## Week 7

In Week 7, the analytics faculty member would introduce working with time series data within the Python programming language.  With this foundation, the faculty member then would demonstrate the creation of appropriate forecasting models using Python.  While the forecasting models from Week 6 would be used, the datasets would be different to illustrawte how differences in data can affect models.  At the end of the week, students would complete homework that required them to integrate their learning from Weeks 6 and 7 by creating and interpreting forecasting models using Python.  Materials such as Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, Jupyter Notebook Python code samples, and CSV data files would be provided to students.

Example materials for this week are contained in the Week 07 folder within this repository.  In addition, this folder contains an in-depth description of the teaching approach.
