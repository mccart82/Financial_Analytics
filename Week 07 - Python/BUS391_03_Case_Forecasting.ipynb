    "This case covers Weeks 06 and 07 of the BUS391 course.  As part of completing this work, you may need knowledge from other weeks in the course (as everything builds on each other in programming), but the focus is work from Weeks 06 and 07.  All of the work for this case should be documented within this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case will be graded using the following standards:\n",
    "* A “no credit” grade indicates that significant gaps exist between the submitted assignment and the expectations such that no credit could be assessed.  \n",
    "* A “needs improvement” grade indicates that you have a good start on meeting the expectations but need further work on the assignment to achieve a “pass” grade.  \n",
    "* A “pass” grade indicates that you have mastered the associated learning outcome.  \n",
    "* A “superior pass” grade is reserved for work that goes significantly beyond mastery of the outcome.  To achieve this designation, the submitted activity must show work that is beyond the provided requirements and adds substantial academic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for this case, a \"pass\" is correct completion of each of the questions/scenarios.  All code should be well commented and follow a logical progression.  Logically break up the code into cells (as appropriate) to make troubleshooting and reading the code easier.  The code should run without error from beginning to end.  Any references used in the completion of this assignment should be listed at the end of this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Canvas submission should be this Jupyter notebook (required).  If you have other files (related to attempting a \"superior pass\" for this assignment), please include those in your submission."
